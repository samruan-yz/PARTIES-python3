**PARTIES.py** is the PARTIES controller described in [the PARTIES paper](https://sc2682cornell.github.io/pdf/PARTIES.pdf). It takes **config.txt** as the input file, which includes the number of colocated applications, and name, IP address and RPS of each colocated application. Real-time tail latency of each application is exposed through an NGINX web interface, running on port 84 on the server machine.

The provided code includes management of only the compute-resources (cores, cache, and frequency), for easier understanding. Management of memory and IO requires more precaution; random allocation may result in applications being killed by the OS for OOM (out of memory), or hanging due to substantial I/O delay. The memory wheel is better removed for non-IO-intensive applications. 
 
**monitorN.py** monitors real-time CPU and LLC utilization. It is not needed in the PARTIES controller since PARTIES doesn't rely on real-time resource usage. You can comment out related lines in PARTIES.py if no monitoring is wanted.
